I guess all levels are passable!
Aliens forgot about earths gravity!
Did you try to make your robot flip upside down?
I can't help you with any level outside of the tutorial.
Stuck? Try the First Contact pack!
Did you collect all the flowers?
Did you know that the robot falls because of gravity?
Did you know that minilens were made by aliens?
I guess that the only missing thing in this game is... apples!
Maybe... you should just push it the other way?
I like climbing up ladders... It is like... flying!
